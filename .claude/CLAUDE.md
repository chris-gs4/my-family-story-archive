# Mabel — Your Stories, Written with Care

Mabel is an AI-powered app that helps people capture the life stories of their parents, friends, or relatives through guided voice journaling — then automatically turns those recordings into polished written narratives and audiobooks. The mascot is a pixel-art grandmother character named Mabel.

## Project Context

### Target Customer
Anyone interested in preserving family stories — adult children who want to capture their parents' memories, people creating meaningful gifts, genealogy enthusiasts, or anyone who wants to turn spoken stories into a beautiful written book.

### Value Proposition
Mabel removes all the friction from preserving family stories. Instead of needing to be a good interviewer, writer, or audio editor, the AI handles the guided questions, audio transcription, narrative creation, and voice cloning in one place. Just tap record, speak, and Mabel writes your story.

### Brand
- **Name:** Mabel
- **Tagline:** Your Stories, Written with Care
- **Mascot:** Pixel-art grandmother character named Mabel
- **Brand assets:** `wireframes/mabel assets/` (logo, square icon, tagline)

### Platform
web + iOS native (Capacitor)

## Tech Stack

TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, React Hook Form, Zod, Prisma ORM, NextAuth.js, Stripe, AWS S3, Vercel, PostgreSQL (Neon), Inngest (background jobs), Capacitor (iOS native)

## Key Documentation

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any work, familiarize yourself with the Confabulator documentation in `confabulator/`:

| Document | Purpose | When to Reference |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `PRD.md` | Feature specs, user stories, acceptance criteria | Before implementing any feature |
| `project-vision.md` | Problem statement, target users, goals | For strategic decisions |
| `implementation-plan.md` | Architecture, tech stack, data model, API routes | Technical implementation |
| `wireframes.md` | UI layouts, screen flows, component placement | Building UI components |
| `business-model-canvas.md` | Revenue, costs, partnerships | Business logic decisions |

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasAccess, canSubmit)
- Use lowercase-with-dashes for directories (components/user-profile)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities

### Before Implementing Features
1. Read the relevant user story in `confabulator/implementation-plan.md`
2. Check acceptance criteria in `confabulator/PRD.md`
3. Reference wireframes in `confabulator/wireframes.md` for UI guidance
4. Follow the data model and API routes in the implementation plan

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Current Focus

The MVP focuses on audio-first guided journaling:

- AI-guided interview questions that adapt based on responses
- Audio recording (native AAC on iOS, WebM on web)
- Audio transcription (Whisper API)
- Narrative generation from transcripts
- Module-based story building (chapter by chapter)

See `confabulator/implementation-plan.md` for the complete development roadmap.
