# Family Story Archive

An AI tool that helps people interview their parents, friends, or relatives about their life stories, then automatically turns those conversations into written narratives and audiobooks using voice cloning.

## Quick Reference

### Bash Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run test         # Run tests

# Database (Prisma)
npx prisma generate      # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev   # Create and apply migrations
npx prisma db push       # Push schema without migrations (dev)
npx prisma studio        # Open database GUI
```

## Project Context

### Target Customer
Anyone interested in writing a book, record an audiobook, or learn more about their family history.

### Value Proposition
It removes all the friction from preserving family stories. Instead of needing to be a good interviewer, writer, or audio editor, the AI handles the structured questions, narrative creation, and voice cloning in one place. 

### Platform
web

## Tech Stack

TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI, React Hook Form, Zod, Prisma ORM, NextAuth.js, Stripe, AWS S3, Vercel, PostgreSQL (Neon), Inngest (background jobs)

## Key Documentation

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any work, familiarize yourself with the Confabulator documentation in `confabulator/`:

| Document | Purpose | When to Reference |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `PRD.md` | Feature specs, user stories, acceptance criteria | Before implementing any feature |
| `project-vision.md` | Problem statement, target users, goals | For strategic decisions |
| `implementation-plan.md` | Architecture, tech stack, data model, API routes | Technical implementation |
| `wireframes.md` | UI layouts, screen flows, component placement | Building UI components |
| `business-model-canvas.md` | Revenue, costs, partnerships | Business logic decisions |

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasAccess, canSubmit)
- Use lowercase-with-dashes for directories (components/user-profile)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities

### Before Implementing Features
1. Read the relevant user story in `confabulator/implementation-plan.md`
2. Check acceptance criteria in `confabulator/PRD.md`
3. Reference wireframes in `confabulator/wireframes.md` for UI guidance
4. Follow the data model and API routes in the implementation plan

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Current Focus

The MVP focuses on these core capabilities:

- AI-guided interview questions that adapt based on responses
- Audio transcription (Whisper API)
- Narrative generation from transcripts

See `confabulator/implementation-plan.md` for the complete development roadmap.
