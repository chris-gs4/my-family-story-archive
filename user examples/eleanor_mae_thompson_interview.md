## Early Life & Childhood

### Q1: What are your earliest memories of growing up?

My earliest memory is helping my mother hang laundry on the line behind our farmhouse. I couldn't have been more than four. The sheets were so white against the blue sky, and they smelled like sunshine. We didn't have much, but I remember feeling so safe.

### Q2: Tell me about your family. What were your parents like?

My father was a quiet man—worked the land from sunup to sundown and rarely complained. He had these big, rough hands, but he was so gentle with us kids. He'd come in after dark smelling like hay and sweat, and my mother would have supper waiting. She was the talker in the family. Strong-willed, deeply religious, and could stretch a dollar farther than anyone I've ever known. We were five children, and somehow she made sure we all had shoes for school and food on the table, even during the lean years. They weren't affectionate in the way people are today—no "I love yous" at bedtime—but you knew they loved you by what they sacrificed.

### Q7: What are your earliest memories of growing up? *(continued)*

Another early memory that stays with me is the sound of the radio in our kitchen. My father would turn it on in the evenings, and sometimes there'd be music—big band, gospel, the news. We didn't have much entertainment, so that radio felt like a window to the whole world. I remember sitting on the floor near the woodstove, listening to some program, and feeling like anything was possible out there. Kansas felt so small, but that radio made the world feel big.

### Q8: Tell me about your family. What were your parents like? *(continued)*

I was the middle child of five—two older brothers, then me, then my younger sister Ruthie, and baby James. Being in the middle meant I learned early how to keep the peace. My brothers were wild, always getting into something, and Ruthie was sickly as a child, so she got a lot of attention. I learned to be useful, to help Mama without being asked. Looking back, I think that shaped me more than anything—learning that love often looks like quiet service, not grand gestures.

## Adolescence & Education

### Q9: What was school like for you?

I loved school, even though I had to walk two miles each way to get there. Our schoolhouse was small—one room for all the grades, one teacher for everyone. I was good at reading and writing, not so good at arithmetic. My teacher, Mrs. Byrd, told me once that I had a gift for words, and I held onto that my whole life. I finished eighth grade, which was as far as most of us went back then. Part of me always wished I could have gone further, maybe become a teacher myself. But farm girls didn't have those options in those days.

### Q10: What did you dream of becoming when you were young?

I wanted to be a teacher more than anything. Mrs. Byrd made it look so noble—standing up there with her chalk and her books, knowing things, helping children understand the world. I used to line up my younger siblings and "teach" them lessons on the porch. Ruthie hated it, but James would sit there and listen to whatever I said. For a while I also dreamed of going to a big city—I'd seen pictures of New York in magazines and thought it looked like another planet. Of course, I ended up in Chicago instead, which felt plenty big enough for a Kansas farm girl.

### Q11: Tell me about your teenage years. What were they like?

My teenage years were about work, mostly. By thirteen I was helping Mama full-time—cooking, cleaning, mending clothes, helping with the younger ones. There wasn't much time for socializing the way kids do now. But I did have a best friend, Loretta, who lived on the next farm over. We'd sneak off to the creek on summer evenings and talk about boys and movie stars and what our lives might become. Those were sweet moments. The war ended when I was about fifteen, and I remember feeling like the whole country exhaled. My brothers came home safe, and that was a blessing not every family got.

## Career & Work Life

### Q12: Tell me about your first real job.

My first real job outside the farm was at a dress shop in town when I was seventeen. I worked Saturdays folding fabric, helping customers, sweeping the floors. The owner, Mrs. Hendricks, was stern but fair. She taught me how to speak to people properly, how to make a sale without being pushy. I earned fifty cents a day, and I saved almost every penny. That money is what eventually got me a bus ticket to Chicago after I turned eighteen. I've never forgotten that feeling of earning my own way for the first time—it changed how I saw myself.

### Q13: What has been your proudest professional accomplishment?

I worked at Marshall Field's department store for twenty-three years, and in 1978 they made me floor supervisor for ladies' wear. I was one of only a few Black women in that position at the time. It wasn't easy getting there—I had to prove myself twice over, be twice as good, never complain. But when they handed me that new name badge with "Supervisor" on it, I called my mother crying. She said, "Baby, you earned that." I kept that badge even after I retired. It reminded me that doors can open if you keep knocking long enough.

### Q14: What was the most challenging period in your career?

The early seventies were hard. Harold got laid off from the steel mill, and suddenly my paycheck was all we had for a family of five. I picked up extra shifts, worked holidays, did whatever they asked. There were days I'd come home so tired I could barely see straight, but the kids needed dinner and homework help, and life doesn't stop just because you're exhausted. We almost lost the house once—got three months behind on the mortgage. But we made it through. That time taught me that pride is a luxury you can't always afford. You do what you have to do for your family.

## Relationships & Family

### Q3: How did you meet your spouse/partner?

I met my Harold at a church dance in 1961, about a year after I moved to Chicago. I didn't even want to go that night—my feet hurt from working the department store all day—but my girlfriend Ruth insisted. He asked me to dance, and I said no at first because he seemed too sure of himself. But he asked again, politely, and something about his smile made me say yes. We were married fourteen months later. Fifty-two years we had together before he passed. I still think about that first dance sometimes.

### Q4: What has been the most important relationship in your life?

That's a hard question because I've been blessed with so many people who shaped me. But if I had to choose, it would be my mother. She taught me how to be a woman—how to keep a home, how to pray, how to hold your head up when things get hard. When I moved to Chicago and felt so alone, I'd call her every Sunday after church. She couldn't always help with money or come visit, but just hearing her voice reminded me who I was and where I came from. I carried her lessons into my marriage, into raising my own children. She passed in 1987, and there's still not a week that goes by when I don't think of something she said.

### Q5: Tell me about becoming a parent (if applicable).

Our first, David, came in 1964. I remember holding him in the hospital and just weeping—happy tears, scared tears, all of it. Harold kept saying, "You're a natural," but I didn't feel natural at all. I felt terrified. Then Patricia came two years later, and by the time Michael arrived in 1970, I'd finally found my footing. Being a mother was the hardest work I've ever done, harder than any job. But watching them grow, seeing pieces of Harold and pieces of myself in them—that was the greatest gift of my life.

### Q15: How did you meet your spouse/partner? *(extended version)*

I've told this story a hundred times, but it never gets old. It was September 1961, at Greater Hope Baptist Church. They were having a welcome social for new members, and my girlfriend Ruth dragged me there even though my feet were aching from work. Harold was standing by the punch bowl looking handsome in his Sunday suit. He asked me to dance—I said no. He waited twenty minutes and asked again. That persistence told me something about his character. We danced three songs in a row, and by the end of the night, I knew he was different. He walked me home and asked if he could call on me. We were married by Christmas the next year.

## Traditions & Culture

### Q6: What traditions or customs are most important to you?

Sunday dinner. No matter what. When the kids were growing up, everyone came to the table—no excuses, no television, no phone calls. We'd have roast chicken or pot roast, say grace together, and just talk. It's how I grew up, and it's what held our family together through everything. Even now, my grandchildren know that if it's Sunday, Grandma's cooking. The recipes have changed a little over the years—my hands aren't what they used to be—but that table is sacred to me. It's where we remember we belong to each other.
