# Mabel Makes It Easy to Capture Your Life Story Through Guided Voice Journaling

## Your Story, Written with Care

Mabel introduces a groundbreaking AI-powered journaling app that helps anyone capture and preserve their life story effortlessly through guided voice recording. With Mabel, there's no writing required — just tap record, speak your memories, and the AI transforms your words into polished written narratives.

Using a unique **module-based approach**, users build their personal story incrementally — one chapter at a time. Each module focuses on a specific theme or life stage, and Mabel's AI learns from previous answers to ask increasingly relevant follow-up questions that help users rediscover memories they'd forgotten. The result: beautifully written chapters that compile into a complete personal memoir.

Mabel isn't about "writing a book." It's a fun, interactive tool that helps you re-access your memories with the guidance of a warm AI companion — a pixel-art grandmother character named Mabel who makes the whole experience feel like chatting with someone who genuinely cares about your story.

### The Problem

Everyone has a life story worth preserving, but very few people ever capture it. The idea of writing a memoir feels overwhelming and reserved for professional authors. Traditional journals lack structure and guidance — most sit half-empty in a drawer. Meanwhile, precious memories fade with time: childhood adventures, pivotal moments, lessons learned, stories that could inspire the next generation. Without an easy way to capture them, these memories are simply lost.

### The Solution

Mabel offers a voice-first, AI-guided approach to personal story preservation:

1. **Start with Module 1:** Tell Mabel about a life chapter (e.g., "Childhood") and she generates thoughtful questions to guide your recording
2. **Just talk:** Tap record and speak naturally — Mabel transcribes and polishes your words into beautiful prose
3. **Watch the magic:** Mabel generates a complete narrative chapter from your answers
4. **Build from there:** Create Module 2, where Mabel generates new questions based on what you've already shared — diving deeper, exploring connections, helping you remember more
5. **Continue the journey:** Complete 3-8 modules to build your complete life story
6. **Download and share:** Export individual chapters or compile everything into a professional PDF

The process makes storytelling accessible, fun, and deeply personal. Mabel's AI learns from each module, asking better questions and creating richer connections between chapters. No writing skills needed, no overwhelm — just your voice and your memories.

### What Users Are Saying

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is Mabel?**
A: Mabel is an AI-powered journaling app that helps you capture your life story through guided voice recording.

Think of it as a warm, encouraging AI companion who helps you rediscover and preserve your personal history.

**Q: Who is Mabel for?**
A: Mabel is for anyone who wants to capture their life story. Whether you're approaching a milestone birthday, want to leave something meaningful for your children, are processing life experiences through reflection, or simply enjoy revisiting old memories — Mabel makes it easy and fun. You can also gift Mabel to a loved one through our Family Plan.

**Q: What makes Mabel different from existing solutions?**
A: Three key innovations: (1) **Voice-first recording** — just tap and talk, no writing required, (2) **Module-based workflow** that prevents overwhelm by breaking the process into manageable chapters, and (3) **Context-learning AI** that gets smarter with each module, helping you rediscover memories you'd forgotten. Plus, Mabel's warm, gamified experience makes it feel fun rather than formal.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Mabel offers a free trial to get started. Full pricing details are available on our website, with options for individual projects and Family Plans at a discounted rate.

**Q: How long does it take to complete my story?**
A: That's entirely up to you! The module system lets you work at your own pace. Some users complete a module per week (finishing in 1-2 months), while others prefer spreading it out. Each module takes 30-60 minutes of recording, plus 2-3 minutes for the AI to generate the chapter.

**Q: Do I need to complete everything at once?**
A: Absolutely not! That's the beauty of the module approach. Record a few answers, save your progress, and come back later — even days or weeks later. Your progress is automatically saved.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does Mabel work technically?**
A: Mabel uses advanced AI (GPT-4) to generate contextually relevant questions and transform your spoken answers into narrative chapters. Audio is transcribed using OpenAI Whisper, then the AI creates polished prose from the transcription. All processing happens in the background — you can close the app and come back when the chapter is ready (usually 2-3 minutes).

**Q: What happens to my data? How secure is it?**
A: Security and privacy are paramount. All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption). Only you can access your stories. We're building GDPR and CCPA compliance features, including data export and deletion rights. We never sell your data or use it to train AI models.

**Q: What if I get stuck or need help?**
A: Mabel is designed to guide you through each step. The module system shows exactly what to do next, and Mabel's questions are crafted to make recording easy and natural. Support resources are also available if you need additional help.
