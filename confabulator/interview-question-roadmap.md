# Interview Question Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for generating AI-powered interview questions that help users capture meaningful family stories. Questions are personalized based on the interviewee's profile and designed to elicit rich, narrative responses.

## Question Generation Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Open-Ended:** Questions invite storytelling, not yes/no answers
2. **Emotionally Resonant:** Questions connect to meaningful experiences and feelings
3. **Chronologically Organized:** Follow life's natural progression
4. **Contextually Aware:** Adapt to generation, culture, and specific topics
5. **Follow-Up Ready:** Each question has natural follow-up paths

### MVP Approach: Post-Recording Generation

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Generate 15-25 questions upfront based on interviewee profile
- User conducts interview using questions as guide
- No real-time adaptation during recording
- Post-interview: Analyze transcription to suggest additional questions for future sessions (Phase 3)

**Phase 2 Enhancement:**
- Real-time question suggestions during live interviews
- Dynamic follow-up generation based on responses
- Sentiment analysis to adjust question tone

## Question Categories

## Implementation Notes

### Question Storage

```typescript
interface InterviewQuestion {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  category: string;
  order: number;
  question: string;
  followUps: string[];
  rationale?: string;
  isFollowUp: boolean;
  parentQuestionId?: string; // For follow-ups
  response?: string; // Filled after interview
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### Generation Algorithm

1. **Collect interviewee profile**: name, relationship, birthYear, topics
2. **Calculate question distribution**: Based on topics, adjust category weights
3. **Select generation-appropriate template**: Match birth year to generation
4. **Call GPT-4** with personalization prompt
5. **Parse and validate** JSON response
6. **Store questions** in database with proper ordering
7. **Allow user editing**: Users can add/remove/reorder questions

### Cost Management

- **Cache question templates** by relationship + generation combination
- **Question generation cost**: ~$0.10-0.20 per project (acceptable)
- **Reuse common questions**: Build library of high-quality base questions
- **User can regenerate**: But track to prevent abuse (max 3 regenerations)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Real-Time Interview Mode

- Transcribe audio in real-time
- Analyze response sentiment and depth
- Dynamically suggest follow-up questions
- Adapt tone based on emotional content

### Phase 3: Advanced Personalization

- Multi-session interview support (progressive questioning)
- Integration with photo albums ("Tell me about this photo...")
- Collaborative question building (family members suggest questions)
- Cultural/religious templates (Jewish life cycle, Catholic traditions, etc.)
