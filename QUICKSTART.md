# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Starting Development

### Step 1: Start PostgreSQL
```bash
# PostgreSQL should auto-start, but if needed:
brew services start postgresql@15
```

### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens at: http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Start Inngest Dev Server (for job queue)
```bash
# In a separate terminal
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```
Opens at: http://localhost:8288

### Optional: View Database
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Opens at: http://localhost:5555

## 🛑 Stopping Development

To cleanly stop all services:

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Stop Inngest (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Stop Prisma Studio (Ctrl+C in terminal)

# PostgreSQL will keep running in background (that's fine)
# To stop PostgreSQL:
brew services stop postgresql@15
```

## 🔧 Useful Commands

### Database
```bash
npm run db:studio        # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:seed          # Re-seed demo data
npx prisma migrate dev   # Run new migrations
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev              # Start Next.js dev server
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run lint             # Check code quality
```

### Debugging
```bash
# View PostgreSQL status
brew services list | grep postgresql

# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3000            # Next.js
lsof -i :5555            # Prisma Studio
lsof -i :8288            # Inngest
```
